## What is AdGuard?  

**AdGuard for macOS** is a comprehensive **ad-blocking and privacy protection tool** designed specifically for Apple computers. It blocks banners, pop-ups, video ads, and trackers on the system level — not just in your browser.  

Unlike traditional browser extensions, **AdGuard Mac** filters all internet traffic across the entire operating system. This means no matter which browser or app you’re using — Safari, Chrome, Firefox, or Edge — AdGuard ensures a cleaner and safer experience.  

The software includes advanced **anti-tracking** and **anti-phishing** modules that protect your identity and prevent access to malicious sites. It also features **DNS protection**, which encrypts your DNS queries, speeds up page loading, and safeguards against data leaks.  

AdGuard isn’t only about blocking ads — it’s about giving users full control over their digital privacy. Whether you’re working, streaming, or browsing, AdGuard guarantees a smoother and faster macOS experience.  

It’s fully optimized for **macOS Ventura, Sonoma, and Monterey**, and runs natively on **Apple Silicon (M1, M2, and M3)** chips for outstanding speed and performance.
